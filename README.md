# U_vA-PBW
This repository includes my work from Oct 2023 - June 2024 on Universal Enveloping Algebras and the PBW Theorem, guided by Prof. Haynes Miller of MIT.

# PDF
The attached PDF includes the mathematical progress made outside of my work on https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07962 (which I co-authored). It consists of an analysis of universal enveloping algebras from the perspective of relations, examples of them, and some discussion regarding PBW theorems.

# Buchberger Algorithm
The attached .ipynb file contains my code for calculating a Grobner basis for determining a universal enveloping algebra. Instructions are contained in the file if one wishes to recreate my work. They are contained in "####" blocks.
